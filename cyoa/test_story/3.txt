Painfully you crawl on, around a bend to the right and then one to the left. 
Somewhere up ahead a voice is chanting--or is it many voices singing in unison? 
It's an eerie tune with only three or four notes. A moment later you reach a dimly lighted chamber. 
A thin, ghostlike figure abruptly stops singing and look at you intently. 
You can hardly find words, but, as if to answer your question before you ask it, this strange man-if he is a man-says, "You have found the oracle of time."
You are amazed to meet anyone in the cave, much less an oracle. 
For a moment you are afraid, but as you look more carefully at the oracle, you can't help but smile. 
His expression is kindly and wise, but there is also a playful, impish look in his eyes. 
You realize he may be able to tell you some things you've wondered about.
"What is time?" you ask. The oracle is silent for a moment but then answers in a firm voice, "Time is what keeps everything from happening at once."
"When did time start?" you ask. "And when will it end?"
"Would you like to see?"
You gulp in amazement. "Sure."
"What then--the beginning or the end?"
11 You say you want to see the beginning of time.
17 You say you want to see the end of time.
