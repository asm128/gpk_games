Your heart races as you make your way through Snake Canyon, looking for the entance to the Cave of Time. 
Though it's a sunny summer day, you're wearing a warm sweater under your allweather parka, as well as wool socks and panb.
You don't know where you'll turn up once you've entered the cave, but you want to be ready for anything.


Finally you reach the familiar grove of pine tees, but your hopes fade as you realize that landslides
have covered the cave's main entrance. Determined not to gtve up, you search the floor of the
canyon until you find, hidden behind clumps of sage, another barely passable enbance.


Crawling on hands and knees, you enter a tunnel that, judging by ib direction, should lead to the main chamber. 
The tunnel seems endless and keeps curving to one side, as if it might be going around in a circle. 
After a half hour of crawling you feel a tightening of the muscles in your throat-the beginning of panic. 
There's not enough room to furn around! You're not even sure you can back out!
