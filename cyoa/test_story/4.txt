Two days later the rest of the tibe leaves in pursuit of the reindeer. Only you and Azog, Larga, and Mi are left. 
The four of you work hard gathering food and supplies so as to be as fully equipped as possible for the hip.
The next morning you help the Neanderthals load supplies onto the raft. 
For the first time you notice that it is nothing more than logs bound with
vines. If you were to run into a stuetch of rapids, the raft would almost certainly come apart. 
Whatever made fuog think this was a good idea? The problem is that these Neanderthals aren't wry smart.
Actually the problem is that you weren't very smart to think they could build a decent raft.
But it's too late to change your mind now. Azog pushes off, and you start down the river. Instead of
paddles you have long poles you use to steer the raft, thrusting one end against the river bottomthe water being only a few feet deep.
