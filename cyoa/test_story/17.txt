"l'd like to see the end," you say. Instanfly you find yourself weighfless, floating in silent space!
Your hands cover your eyes as you try to shield them from the brilliant light of a sun much larger
and brighter than our own sun. You are rolling over and over in space, feeling like meat on a
barbecue spit. The side of you facing the sun is so hot, it would burst into flame if it weren't cooled by
the near absolute zero temperature as it turns away from the light. You have no sense of time. For
hours, maybe days, you rollgenfly over and over like a misshapen little asteroid.
All the while this one enormous sun is shrinking ever more rapidly -while growing ever more brilliant- until you can see it even 
through your arms shielding your closed eyes. Then utter darkness. Nothingness.
Moments later you find yourself in the chamber of the oracle, blinking as your eyes slowly adjust to the pale-green light.
