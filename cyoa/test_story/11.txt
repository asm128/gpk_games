"l'd like to see the beginning," you say, and instantly you find yourself floating, weighfless, in totally black space!
There are no stars or suns or moons or wisps of light; not a breath of air; 
no sound; no smell or taste; no up or down or sideways; no motion; no feeling; nothing but silence.
Then suddenly there's a point of light so brilliant, it feels like pins dnuen into your eyeballs!
Even before you can blink, the light expands like a million lightning bolts radiating in all directions. 
Your eyes shut, but the light is still painfully bright. fu you move your hands to cover your eyes you scream-but no sound comes.
At the same moment darkness returns. Then, very slowly your eyes begin to adjust to the dim Iight of your surroundings, 
and you realue you are once again in the chamber of the oracle.
